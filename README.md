# SENG1120
Labs and Projects for Data Structures Sem 2 UoN

## Assignments
Assignments have their own folders and branches. There very well might be branches running before an assignment is due but they will be merged to master in their final form on or before due date.

So if you are here to mark only mark master code.

## Labs
Pretty self explanatory but let's explain it anyway. All Labs and Tutorials are in Lab folders. Each folder contains all the files you need including makefile so switching to any of those directories and running:

`make`

Followed by:

`make clean`

Will build your program. Run it like this:

`./exec_file.exe`

If you aren't sure what the executable is called just run a `ls` to find it

Before anyone outside the course asks all builds are flagged with `-std=c++98` because this course is making us think about memory. There is a reason.

## Questions??
Sure thing here is my student email for this repo:

Email: c3304972@uon.edu.au

Drop me a message and I will get back ASAP

Cheers!
